# haskpong

A simple Pong game written in Haskell, using the Gloss graphics package. W,S control left, up and down control right, p un/pauses.

It ended up being neat and tidy, mostly, but still quite verbose. The record syntax became cumbersome when modifying nested attributes of data types; lenses could be used to simplify this somewhat, I think.
